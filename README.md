Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

 Three observable trends:
 1. Based on gender Males dominate the purchasing gender at 84% of the 576 total players while Females is 14%. 
 2. Our main target age brackets are the following Age Group ("20 - 24" at 44.79%), ("15 - 19" at 18.58%) and 3rd is ("25 - 29" at 13.37%).
 3. Even though Pursuit, Cudgel of Necromancy was popularl with 8 purchases it brought back very little value for our cost at 8.16 per purchase. While Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm at 12 purchase brought back $50.76 per purchase.
